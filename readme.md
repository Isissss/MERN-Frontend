# MERN Kanban Board - Front-end

This project was part of a (full-stack) course at the University of Applied Sciences Rotterdam. This is the front-end part for an API that we created. I chose to build a kanban board. 
## Tech Stack

**Client:** Bootstrap (bootstrap-react), React 

**Server:** Node, Express, MongoDB


## Lessons Learned
This was my first app using React. I have learned to:
- Implement the basic CRUD functionalities (using [my own api](https://github.com/Isissss/MERN-Frontend)) using react components
- Use the React hooks useState, useEffect, useContext, useRef, Fragments
- Work with the libraries [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) and [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
 

## Future additions
Due to the lack of time there are plenty of things that I was not able to implement. In the future I would like to add the following:
- Live updates through Socket.IO 
- Ability to add boards
- Add indexes to list order and fix bug when dragging a card in the same list
- Add an authentication system
